## Background

**Lots** of people face discrimination because of their skin colour, religious beliefs, political views, origins, and gender.

People struggle to keep a happy life and deal with mental and psychological damage because of discrimination. It's time for a change.

## Technology stack

- AWS EC2
- NodeJS
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- Joi
- Redis
- GraphQL (Apollo-Express)

* React
* Zustand
* Storybook
* Urql
* Cypress
* Sass
* Webpack

I coupled this stack with Firebase Authentication and used Trello in addition to GitHub. I also setup TravisCI for frontend code alongside Jest and ESLint to make sure new code 'just works'.

> Sadly this project never made it to production because it costs a lot for a student like myself. ðŸ˜…

## Challenges

Discriminatory was my most ambitious project yet. It was the first time I build a full GraphQL API with authentication, authorisation, and rate-limiting. It was also my first time working with the AWS platform, provided I'm a frontend developer!

- Localising this React monolith
- Providing more enjoyable user experience
- Speeding up the GraphQL API (which was _really_ slow at first, and responded in an average of 10 seconds)

### Localising this React monolith

For this, I had to use _react-intl_ (Format.JS). _react-intl_ uses JSON objects to process translation `messages`. Instead of creating a localisation API endpoint I opted for build-time compiled JSON files. This, combined with cdn and client-side caching, saved a lot of resources both on the server and the client. Each view/page loaded its JSON localisation files and passed them dynamically to the _react-intl_ provider by updating the localisation store.

### Providing an awesome user experience

Researching date pickers, custom dropdown select list, and custom input fields lead me to the conclusion that the React ecosystem overflows with over-engineered and poorly-maintained utilities that introduce more problems than they solve.

> One would expect a 100KB (gzipped!) select dropdown downloaded 2.5M times a week to be _at least_ accessible to some extent, but you'd be **so wrong**.

So I opted for a custom component library. I built all components from scratch and tested their accessibility using ESLint _jsx-a11y_ and _react-axe_.

I mostly used the browsers' default. That harmed the _uniqueness_ of the website a bit but provided a more familiar way of doing things. It also allowed me to boost the performance of components on low-end devices since the interfaces are built-in ðŸ˜‰.

### Speeding up the GraphQL API

The API had an average response time of ~10 seconds. Slow Mongoose queries contributed most of it, and GraphQL query validation was another bottleneck. I benchmarked using _autocannon_.

```
type Post {
  # Some simple types
  author: User
  location: Location!
  reactions: ReactionData!
  comments: [Comment!]!
}

type Comment {
	# Some simple types
	author: User
}
```

Each of those fields started a sub-query which potentially had another, deeper sub-query.

- Location went for the Location collection to fetch specific information about each post.
- Reactions fetched, aggregated, and compiled data for easy reactions display like on Facebook.
- A comment `Comment` had an author `User` sub-query, and each author had things like member `Badges` that acted as a sub-query.

Now repeat this for 20 posts per screen, per user. The API was crying. So I had to change a bunch of stuff.

- Mongoose by default wraps all query results in `Document` objects to populate methods that allow for further interaction with models. I didn't need that in most cases, so the _lean()_ option was perfect. That cut average query time _in half_.

- An author may have a post and a few comments on that post. Caching their `User` objects cut down on both memory and database load.

- Caching user feeds improved responses greatly, a user would get the same posts over a period of time before updating their cache, instead of re-compiling their feed on every refresh.

- JIT compiling GraphQL queries also cut down a lot of the left-over delay. With this change, Apollo doesn't need to re-validate previous queries anymore.

- Rate limiting requests also cut down on API load.

## Results

Results were more than fascinating!

- The whole frontend was less than a megabyte! Thanks to Webpack chunking, route-based code-splitting, and the custom components that cut down on the number of external dependencies the project depended on React, Zustand, and Urql only! Add client-side caching to this and voila, instant loading!

- The API's average response time was down to `<1s` in the worst case, and repeated requests such as the home feed and reactions were down to `<100ms` because of the caching mechanisms I set in place!

## Conclusions

Like I said, my most ambitious project yet. Working on this project made me see a bigger picture I wasn't aware had existed. It allowed me to learn new experiences in things like GraphQL JIT, scalability, project management, risk management and mitigation, and more. I'm happy I worked on this and would love to do it again!
