# Useless is not worthless ðŸš€

Most of my projects are open source and free to use. Some of these don't
have any other purpose than exploration and experimenting.


<a href='https://github.com/kl13nt/loggy'>
	<h3>Loggy!</h3>
</a>

Loggy is a browser extension that logs the time you spend on each website to beautifully give you insights on your internet habits. It's built with JavaScript, VueJS, and Tailwind, back by Webpack and Babel for the development and production pipelines.

<a href='https://github.com/kl13nt/clippy'>
	<h3>Clippy!</h3>
</a>

Clippy is a minimal clipboard history log made with
[Electron](https://electronjs.org), [Preact](https://preactjs.com), and
[htm](https://github.com/developit/htm). It doesn't store nor sync your
clipboard. I needed to keep track of my clipboard and didn't find any
trust-worthy tools that were free/open-source, so I created mine!

	<h3>My Blog</h3>

This very website. Built with NextJS, MDX, Tailwind, and Sass. I don't have much to say about it except that I designed and developed it all from the ground up, and maintain it from time to time. Oh, I hooked it up to NetlifyCMS recently too! A much better blogging workflow if you ask me. ðŸ˜„
