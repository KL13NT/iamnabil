# What Nabil uses

Tools I use to be productive, all around.

#### Setup

I have two machines, one is a gaming rig I built and the other is an old mid-low-end laptop. I mostly work on my PC now since it's much more powerful and only use the laptop for movies and whatnot. 

- MSI B560M-A PRO
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti OC Twin Edge LHR 8GB
- Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11400 11th Gen
- 16GB of DDR4 3200 Mhz
- 500GB of NVMe Gen3 Storage + 1TB of Western Digital Blue 7200RPM

#### Editor + Terminal üë®‚Äçüíª

- [Visual Studio Code] is my current editor. I switched to it back in 2018.
- I'm using [Horizon] as my main theme and sometimes switch to [Noctis High Contrast]. My favourite editor fonts are [Space Mono] and [FiraCode].
- Firefox is my main browser. I use Firefox Nightly and Chrome for development and testing.
- [Cmder] is my terminal of choice with custom theme and [integrations].

#### Productivity üí™

- [Notion] is my main editorial app. Blog post drafts, to-do, and channel-related stuff.
- [Trello] for project management.
- [Google Calendar] and Tasks for all calendar and todo stuff
- As for time-tracking, I use a tool that I built myself called [AuditMyDay].

Anything else? Probably have a bash/node script for it.
