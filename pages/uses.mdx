# What Nabil uses

Tools I use to be productive, all around.

#### Hardware

- I currently use a PC I built myself. You can find the whole thing on [PCPartPicker].
- My monitor is a 21.5" 1080p Dell, it gets the job done for what I need.
- I use a repurposed computer table I had lying around the house. I plan on
  making a desk with a countertop similar to [IKEA's ALEX] desks.
- The keyboard is a TKL Redragon K552 RGB for that sweet "throw" distance to the
  mouse.
- Mouse is a Logitech G502 HERO.


#### Editor + Terminal üë®‚Äçüíª

- [Visual Studio Code] is my current editor. I switched to it back in 2018.
- I'm using [Horizon] as my main theme and sometimes switch to [Noctis High
  Contrast]. My favourite editor fonts are [Space Mono] and [FiraCode]. 
- Firefox is my main browser. I use Firefox Nightly and Chrome for development and testing.
- [Cmder] is my terminal of choice with custom theme and [integrations].

#### Productivity üí™

- [Notion] is my main editorial app. Blog post drafts, to-do, and channel-related stuff.
- [Trello] for project management.
- [Google Calendar] and Tasks for all calendar and todo stuff
- As for time-tracking, I use a tool that I built myself called [AuditMyDay].

Anything else? Probably have a bash/node script for it.
