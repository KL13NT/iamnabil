# Development Environment

This is my development environment setup. Tools I use to be productive, all around.

#### Editor + Terminal 👨‍💻

- [Visual Studio Code] is my current editor. I switched to it back in 2018.
- I'm using [Horizon] as my main theme and sometimes switch to [Noctis High Contrast]. My favourite editor fonts are [Space Mono] and [FiraCode].
- Firefox is my main browser. I use Firefox Nightly and Chrome for development and testing.
- [Cmder] is my terminal of choice with custom theme and [integrations].

#### Productivity 💪

- [Notion] is my main editorial app. Blog post drafts, to-do, and channel-related stuff.
- [Trello] for project management.
- [Google Calendar] and Tasks for all calendar and todo stuff
- As for time-tracking, I use a tool that I built myself called [AuditMyDay].

Anything else? Probably have a bash/node script for it.

#### Recording + Editing 📹

- OBS to record any and all videos.
- Streamlabs OBS for live streams.
- Adobe Audition Pro for audio recording and editing.
- Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing.
- Figma is my preferred design tool for everything.
