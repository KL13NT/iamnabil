# I discovered code at about 12 and fell in love with it...

Prior to discovering code I had never wanted to become anything specific. I
tried art, music, sports, and a bunch of other stuff that I ended up getting
bored of. Then I discovered code when we had to learn Visual Basic, and it blew
my mind.

In 2018 I enrolled in the B.Sc. (Bachelor of Computer Science) program at Cairo
University. I created a community for students, went global with it, and was the
lead in every project/coding team created then.

The summer between my Freshman and Sophomore years I completed an internship at
Unplugged in Cairo, Egypt. I worked on an
online-payment solution and learned how to work with React at scale. They had us
suggest ideas to work on, and I managed to become lead of the interns team.

The summer between my Sophomore and Junior years I worked on Discriminatory, a
social network built with NodeJS, GraphQL, Authentication, AWS, React, and a
bunch of other tools. It was a _long_ (5+ months) summer because of COVID. I
learned a lot during this period which set me up for success later on.

Then between my Junior and Senior years I completed a remote
internship and began my career at Acute Business. I worked
primarily with TypeScript, React, and the tooling that come with them. During
the next year I would single-handedly build the Qalam learning management system
UI. This was a major accomplishment for me as I had never used React for
proprietary code until this point. 

In September of 2021 I was approached by CTO of Robusta. He wanted me to join the 
engineering team and help build great software. I look forward to the great 
adventures that lie ahead.

I'm the host of [The Weekly Noob](http://theweeklynoob.netlify.app/)
podcast. I've also created a technical YouTube channel to share my thoughts and
ideas. I also mentor students and fresh graduates. 

My story is to be continued.
