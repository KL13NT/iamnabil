title: AI Generated Docs Don't Work
---

AI generated business documentation does NOT work out of the box.

The main audience for documentation is humans; developers, business people, users. While AI documentation "sounds" good, it lacks the necessary means to deliver information tailored to the human mind in specific business contexts.

If you lack experience collecting feedback and optimising documentation for people, chances are you're going to end up with completely useless documentation. Regardless of the prompt you use or the number of iterations you do with the model.

And not only useless, but also harmful. It "looks" like you do have documentation. It "looks" like you don't need to write it again. People will starting referring to it.

But if that documentation doesn't actually carry the value it _could_ and _should_ carry, consumers are just going to end up with more unanswered questions and frustration, which will eventually force you to go in and manually adjust and improve the content according to the feedback you collect.

Draft all you want with AI, but always make sure the documentation you create is actually useful to your target audience, whoever it may be.
