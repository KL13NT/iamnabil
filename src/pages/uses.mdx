# What Nabil uses

Tools I use to be productive, all around.

#### Hardware

- I currently use a PC I built myself. You can find the whole thing on [PCPartPicker].
- I use two monitors, a 21.5" Dell P2214H and a 24" Acer VG240Y S.
- I use a repurposed computer table I had lying around the house. I plan on
  making a desk with a countertop similar to [IKEA's ALEX] desks.
- The keyboard is a TKL Redragon K552 RGB for that sweet "throw" distance to the
  mouse.
- Mouse is a Logitech G502 HERO.

#### Editor + Terminal üë®‚Äçüíª

- [Visual Studio Code] is my current editor. I switched to it back in 2018.
- I'm using [Horizon] as my main theme and sometimes switch to [Noctis High
  Contrast]. My favourite editor fonts are [Space Mono] and [FiraCode].
- Firefox is my main browser. I use Firefox Nightly and Edge for development and testing.
- Windows Terminal is my terminal of choice with Oh My Posh!.

#### Productivity üí™

- [Notion] is my main editorial app. Blog post drafts, to-do, and channel-related stuff.
- [Trello] for project management.
- [Google Calendar] and Tasks for all calendar and todo stuff

Anything else? Probably have a bash/node script for it.

#### Desktop Apps

- Firefox (Personal)
- Microsoft Edge (Work)
- Notion
- Google Calendar
- Thunderbird
- NordVPN + Cloudflare WARP
- Spotify
- Discord

#### Browser Extensions

- NoScript
- Privacy Badger
- Search by Image
- Sidebery
- Stylus
- Tabliss

#### Recording + Editing üìπ

- OBS to record any and all videos.
- Streamlabs OBS for live streams.
- Davinci Resolve for video editing.
- Adobe Audition Pro for audio recording and editing.
- Figma is my preferred design tool for everything.
